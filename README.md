# Cellular-Automata-and-Rock-Paper-Scissors-simulation

# q1
Given a pattern on a grid, come up with the rules, initial state and the number of iterations for a cel-
lular automaton that will reach the pattern. The cellular automaton you are designing is constrained
on a square grid with binary values. Each cell will have 8 neighbours and can have the value 0 or 1.

# q2
A program which, when given as input, a finite state automaton
(FSA) which plays Rock-Paper-Scissors (RPS) with an unknown initial state, outputs a FSA that
beats it in as many rounds as possible.
